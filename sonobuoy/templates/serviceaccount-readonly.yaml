Enabling this manifest enables the usage of a ServiceAccount with
readonly permissions for Sonobuoy plugins that mount the created
token.

To use this readonly ServiceAccount mount the ServiceAccountToken in
`values.yaml` like:

```
conf:
  plugins:
    - name: plugin-needing-readonly.yaml
      data: |
        sonobuoy-config:
          driver: Job
          plugin-name: plugin-needing-readonly
          result-type: plugin-needing-readonly
        spec:
          name: plugin-needing-readonly
          image: "plugin-needing-readonly:latest"
          imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /tmp/results
            name: results
            readOnly: false
          - name: readonly-token
            # It's recommended to use this mountPath to overwrite the
            # Sonobuoy service account credentials that are mounted
            # by default in the plugin containers to prevent plugins
            # from accidentally using credentials with full permissions.
            mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
        extra-volumes:
        - name: readonly-token
          secret:
            secretName: sonobuoy-readonly-serviceaccount-token-secret
```

After mounting the readonly token, the example at
https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/tree/3fb2be14e18d84edef094bbd908b6bb3e39aafe6#example
may be referenced to list pods, etc.
